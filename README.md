# Endless_Def

This is my first game I did with SFML and C++ unfortunately I discontinued this project because it was not well designed and I wanted to rebuild the core of my game.

## Modes
### Map editor
- Allows the editing of the game map as well as the creation of new maps.

### Playmode
- Features a movable player with collision with the environment.
- In the current state the game has no goals or achievements.
